    <h1 id="tittle">Different Functions on console</h1>
<p>If you want to start a console code you need to do the script code first and if you are writing words or something you are saying in the variable space. You need to add double codes. </p>
<p>To open console you need to right click on the screen and then click on the inspect button. Over there you need to click the console the button on the top. We use console to check if everything is working and then we actually show on to the screen because then we know it will work.</p>


<script>
    var first_name="Aarav"
console.log(first_name);

var last_name="Valecha"
console.log(last_name);

var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
console.log(full_name);

var a=10;
var b=5;

var sub= a - b;
console.log(sub);

var add= a + b;
console.log(add);

var square_root=Math.sqrt(500);
console.log(square_root);


var divide=a / b  ;
console.log(divide);
